**Kartavya.in** is a civic-tech web platform aimed at empowering Indian citizens, especially youth, to actively participate in community development by reporting local civic issues, joining volunteer drives, and learning about their rights and duties. The platform provides an easy-to-use interface where users can upload reports with location and photos, explore nearby social initiatives, and access educational resources on civic topics like RTI, voting, and government schemes. Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, Kartavya promotes transparency, accountability, and civic awareness, making it easier for citizens to turn responsibility into real-world action.
